# Data exploration

## Motivation

In this section, we **explore** the data from package `palmerpenguins`. A recent publication from the researcher, Dr Kristen Gorman, who shared the data is @Connors2020.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

The data are displayed below (first 10 rows) : 



```{r}
penguins %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% # Slice as the verb say is to cut a tibble in piece, another of subsetting
  knitr::kable() # Remember kable is the function that helps you to display table. It is built in in knitr
```

## Numerical exploration

Here we will make use of *inline code*. 
There are `r nrow(penguins)` penguins in the dataset, and `r length(unique(penguins$species))` different species. The data were collected in `r length(unique(penguins$island))` islands of the Palmer archipelago in Antarctica. 

The mean of all traits that were measured on the penguins are:

```{r echo = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Inline code is powerful because, when the dataset chages or the number of obsevation changes, this will automatically be detected and updated.
You remember there were missing values for some individuals for the sex?
We can now change ...

## Graphical exploration

A histogram of body mass per species:
```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = body_mass_g) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body mass")
```
