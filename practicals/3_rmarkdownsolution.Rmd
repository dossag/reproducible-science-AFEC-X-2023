# Data exploration

## Motivation

In this section, we **explore** the data from package `palmerpenguins`. A recent publication from the researcher, Dr Kristen Gorman, who shared the data is @Connors2020.
We will also use the package "citr" for refering to scientic citation as well. Howeve, please rember that "citr" is not hosted by [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) but rather on [GitHub citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr). You can install it by doing `devtools::install_github("crsh/citr").`

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

The data are displayed below (first 10 row) : 

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% # Slice as the verb say is to cut a tibble in piece, another of sub-setting
  knitr::kable() # Remember kable is the function that helps you to display table. It is built in in knitr
```

## Numerical exploration

Here we will make use of *inline code*. 
There are `r nrow(penguins)` penguins in the dataset, and `r length(unique(penguins$species))` different species. The data were collected in `r length(unique(penguins$island))` islands of the Palmer archipelago in Antarctica. 

The mean of all traits that were measured on the penguins are:

```{r echo = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE))# We use across() combined with where(is.numeric()) to only compute mean for numeric variable. na.rm=TRUE removes any missing values NA prior to computing.
```

Inline code is powerful because, when the data set changes or the number of observations changes, this will automatically be detected and updated.
You remember there were missing values for some individuals for the sex?
We can now change change the inline code to only render the individual with know sex.

```{r}
dat <- penguins %>%
# filter out missing sex
  filter(!is.na(sex)) %>% 
# select variables
  select(species, island, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) 

glimpse(dat)

```

Here we will make use of *inline code* but on the dataset dat which contains no missing vavlues. 
There are `r nrow(dat)` penguins in the dataset, and `r length(unique(dat$species))` different species. The data were collected in `r length(unique(dat$island))` islands of the Palmer archipelago in Antarctica. 

## Graphical exploration

A histogram of body mass per species:
```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = body_mass_g) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                 alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body mass")
```
